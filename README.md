# About

This is a straight forward follow along to the [flask mega tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

I wrote two custom scripts [replace_templates.py](https://github.com/rortms/flask-tutorial-microblog/blob/master/replace_templates.py) and
[translatepo.py](https://github.com/rortms/flask-tutorial-microblog/blob/master/translatepo.py), to automate language localization when a flask app 
was not intially implemented with language translation in mind. The first uses regular expressions to insert the translation tags on most
text needing to be translated and the second can be used to roughly translate a po file through a translation API such as Yandex's or Microsoft's.
